# ML-algorithms
My implementation of various ML algorithms. Most of them are to be tested on the MNIST dataset. The point is to look at the details myself. 

## Simple Algorithms
[ ] Linear Regression
[ ] Logistic Regression
[ ] Naive Bayes
[ ] Support Vector Machine (w/ or w/o kernels?)
[ ] Random Forest
[ ] Ensemble (?)

## Gaussian
[ ] Linear Discriminant Analysis
[ ] Quadratic Discriminant Analysis?
[ ] EM for Mix of Gaussian Model

## PGM
[ ] Bayes Net
[ ] Conditional Random Fields (for OCR)
[ ] HMM (Forward estimation, Viterbi decode, Balm-Welch training)
[ ] Variational Auto-Encoder

## Neural Network
[ ] Feedforward MLP
[ ] CNN
[ ] RNN
[ ] GAN
[ ] Recurrent Convolutional Neural Nets
[ ] YOLO, RCNN, Mask-RCNN, Faster-RCNN (for image segmentation?)
